In this folder you can find the code scripts and the data for the analysis that was done for my thesis with title Investigation and mapping of the lunar magnetic field. My dissertation is presented in fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Mathematics of KU Leuven.
Here is a list of the content:
3 code scripts: Code 1 - For the creation of the total lunar magnetic field datasets, Code 2 - For the investigation of the mini-magnetospheres and Code 3 - For the investigation of null points in the luanr atmosphere. 
A data folder that contains: solar wind data and a small dataset for one of the four points of interest which is a possible null point 
All the scripts contain comments to guide the user how to use them. 
I hope you will find this analysis useful.
